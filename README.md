# Image-processing
if the image has a table having 5 rows and 3 columns (columnA , column B and column C). The extracted text will have one column - with 5 values of columnA followed by 5 values of columnB then by column C. Hence 15 values and 1 column will be the extracted text. 

this is an algorithm to get the corresponding value of columnB for a given specific value of the columnC
